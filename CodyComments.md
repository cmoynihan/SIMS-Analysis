# General 
- You should change this into a package structure
    - This gives you much more portability
    - Make it such that the wrappers for gui manipulation are sufficiently separate from SIMS specific things
    - I will also add a package to this and it will help to stay organized
- Needed files should be placed in their own directory
    - the sequence.csv files should be in a sequences or something folder
    - each sequence should be names a bit more specifically
- Depth.txt should go into an examples directory    
- I have marked up your python files 
    - Comments started with #! are mine
- Your exporter lacks the ability to handle entry boxes which is important for saving
- You need docstrings on all methods and classes (unless extremely obvious)
- I want you to work on making the code more robust
